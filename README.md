## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use `clangFormat-Builder` you need to install [clang-format](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) tool. Also, you can find llvm project at [GitHub](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project).

### Installation

#### Via GitHub

1. Download packaged binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/rjelonek/clangFormat-Builder/releases)
2. Add to components via `Components->Install Packages`

#### Build from source

1. Open project in your IDE (you can find project file at `build/cXX`, where XX is version of C++Builder)
2. Build and install

> At `build` folder are only projects for C++Builder XE7 and 10.3. If you use another version just open one of existing projects.
